The Space Force Game
====================

ABOUT: This game is loosely based on the classic 2D Space Shooter "Asteroids", with some improvements such as asteroid-seeking missiles, a selection of weapons and a scoring system.

TO PLAY: Download the folder and give it a go - you just need to open the index.html file to load the JS code. Checked on Edge, Chrome and Firefox. For best results, set zoom to 80%.

IMPROVEMENTS: This game is not perfect. Possible improvements are the implementation of a scoring system and including enemy ships. In addition, there could be some improvements in adapting the game to different screen sizes, as at the moment the default resolution is 1600 x 900.
